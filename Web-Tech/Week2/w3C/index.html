                <h2>STANDARDS</h2>
                <p>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented
                    potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores,
                    that are available on any device. Although the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve,
                    industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how HTML5 will be the cornerstone for this platform.
                    But the full strength of the platform relies on many more technologies that W3C and its partners are
                    creating, including CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and a variety of APIs.</p><br>

                <p>W3C develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize
                    consensus about the content of a technical report, to ensure high technical and editorial quality,
                    and to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader community.</p><br>

                <p>If you are learning about Web technology, you may wish to start with the introduction below, and
                    follow links for greater detail.</p>

                    <h2>PARTICIPATE</h2>
                    <p>W3C invites the public to participate in W3C via discussion lists, events, blogs, translations,
                        and other means described below. Participation in W3C Community and Business Groups is open to
                        all. Participation in W3C Working Groups (and other types) is open to W3C Members and other
                        invited parties. W3C groups work with the public through specification reviews as well as
                        contributions of use cases, tests, and implementation feedback.</p>
